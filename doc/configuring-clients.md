# Applications

Managing applications can be done from using the Applications option from main menu. This will allow:

 * creating an application
 * changing its properties
 * deleting an application


The main properties of an application are:

 * name
 * internal key - appkey - communication key string identifying the external application as a Concorda client. This should be the same as the appkey set in the concorda's [client ](./install-clients.md) options.
 * others - TBD
