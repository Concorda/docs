# Clients

External applications that are using Concorda as authentication/authorization service providers are implemented in Concorda as clients.

Managing clients can be done from using the Clients option from main menu. This will allow:
* creating a client
* changing its properties
* deleting a client


The main properties of a client are:
* name
* internal key - communication key string identifying the external application as a Concorda client
* registration type - open or closed
* active social login auth providers - available options are Google, Github and Twitter
